    "> 1. Even though we made a fairly simple model to make the model SED emission, there were still a lot of parts that went into getting out an SED. Many times in science we have to make choices about making and fitting models in terms of which parts of them we should \"freeze\" and which things we should vary. Generally, it's a better choice to freeze aspects of the model that we are more confident about, have a measurement or previous constraint on, or are set by the physics rather than just a choice of parameter. \n",
    "> Of the three main aspects of the model:  \n",
    "> a. Temperature profile  \n",
    "> b. Surface density profile  \n",
    "> c. Dust Opacity   \n",
    "> Which do you think would be best to freeze and which do you think would be best to vary? Explain your reasoning.\n",

    "*your answers here*\n",
    "\n",
    "> 2. The other tricky thing about model fitting is *degeneracy*: when two aspects or parameters of the model contribute to changing the same part of the model. i.e. raising one parameter's value affects the value of the model at some range of wavelengths in the same way as raising or lowering a different parameter's value. What is one potential source of degeneracy you can identify in this model?\n",

    "> 3. (Very Optional Bonus) This Mystery Object is a real bona fide disk observation that has been actually fit in the literature with multiple components: (each having it's own range of radii, temperatures, and opacities) with a different model for the inner disk vs. the outer disk. Create a two component model of your own for these observations that does a better job of representing the features in the data. How is the inner disk different from the outer disk?\n",
